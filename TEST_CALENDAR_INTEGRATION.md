# 🚀 Calendar Integration - Ready to Test!

The Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar integration has been successfully implemented and is ready for testing.

## ✅ What's Ready

### **Backend**
- ✅ Database tables created successfully
- ✅ Google Calendar service (configured with your credentials)
- ✅ Outlook Calendar service (graceful degradation if not configured)
- ✅ Calendar sync service with background processing
- ✅ API endpoints for OAuth and management
- ✅ Cron jobs for automatic sync processing

### **Frontend**
- ✅ Calendar Integration page at `/coaches/calendar`
- ✅ Navigation menu updated with "Calendar Integration" link
- ✅ UI components installed (Switch, Dialog, Tabs, etc.)
- ✅ OAuth callback handling
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback

### **Dependencies**
- ✅ Backend: `googleapis`, `@azure/msal-node` installed
- ✅ Frontend: `@radix-ui/react-switch`, `sonner` installed

## 🧪 How to Test

### **1. Start the Application**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### **2. Access Calendar Integration**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/coaches` (or your frontend port)
2. Login as a coach
3. Click "Calendar Integration" in the left sidebar
4. You should see the calendar integration page

### **3. Test Google Calendar Connection**
1. Click "Connect Google Calendar"
2. You should be redirected to Google OAuth
3. Grant permissions to your Google Calendar
4. You should be redirected back with a success message
5. The connection should appear in the list with sync settings

### **4. Test Sync Functionality**
1. Create a test appointment through your existing booking system
2. Within 2 minutes, it should appear in your Google Calendar
3. Try rescheduling the appointment - it should update in Google Calendar
4. Try cancelling the appointment - it should be removed from Google Calendar

### **5. Test Settings**
1. Click the settings button (⚙️) on a connected calendar
2. Try different privacy settings (include/exclude client details)
3. Customize event titles and descriptions
4. Test manual sync with "Sync Now" button

## 📋 Expected Behavior

### **Google Calendar (Ready)**
- ✅ OAuth flow should work with your existing credentials
- ✅ Appointments sync as calendar events
- ✅ Privacy controls work (client names included/excluded)
- ✅ Custom event templates work
- ✅ Real-time sync (within 2 minutes)

### **Outlook Calendar (Not Configured)**
- ⚠️ "Connect Outlook Calendar" shows helpful error message
- ℹ️ This is expected since Microsoft credentials aren't set up

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If OAuth fails:**
- Check that `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are correct
- Verify the redirect URI matches: `http://localhost:3001/api/calendar-integration/callback`

### **If sync doesn't work:**
- Check backend logs for sync job processing
- Verify cron jobs are running (should see "Processing calendar sync queue..." every 2 minutes)
- Check the `calendar_sync_queue` table for failed jobs

### **If UI doesn't load:**
- Check that all UI components are imported correctly
- Verify toast notifications work
- Check browser console for errors

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**The integration is working correctly when:**
- ✅ OAuth connection to Google Calendar succeeds
- ✅ Appointments automatically appear in Google Calendar
- ✅ Event details match your privacy settings
- ✅ Manual sync works on demand
- ✅ Connection settings can be modified
- ✅ No errors in backend or frontend logs
