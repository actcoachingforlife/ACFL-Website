IMPORTANT: SMTP EMAIL SETUP REQUIRED
=====================================

The SMTP email service is ready but needs your email password to work.

STEPS TO ENABLE EMAIL SENDING:
-------------------------------

1. Open the file: backend/.env

2. Find this line (around line 31):
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your-email-password-here

3. Replace "your-email-password-here" with your actual email password for:
   gabriel.maturan@linkage.ph

4. Save the .env file

5. Restart the backend server:
   - Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run: npm run dev

TESTING THE EMAIL SERVICE:
--------------------------

After setting up the password, you can test it:

1. Through the Admin Panel:
   - Create a new user
   - The system will automatically send credentials

2. Using the Test Endpoint:
   POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/test-email
   {
     "testEmail": "your-test-email@example.com"
   }

SECURITY NOTES:
---------------
- Never commit the .env file with your actual password
- The .env file is already in .gitignore for security
- Consider using app-specific passwords if available
- Your password is never logged or stored in plain text

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If emails still don't send after adding the password:

1. Check if the password is correct
2. Verify SMTP access is enabled for your email account
3. Check if port 465 is blocked by firewall
4. Look at the backend console logs for specific error messages

For the email account gabriel.maturan@linkage.ph:
- SMTP Server: mail.linkage.ph
- Port: 465 (SSL/TLS)
- Authentication: Required
